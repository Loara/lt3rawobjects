# rwobj
Objects and proxies in LaTeX3

## Manual installation

If you need a version of this package that is not present in your TeXLive/MiKTeX distribution you can run one of the following commands in order to generate the `.sty` file

    pdflatex rwobj.ins
    xelatex rwobj.ins
    lualatex rwobj.ins
    uplatex rwobj.ins

if your distribution is up to date all these options should be equivalent, I personally recommend to use `lualatex` but is only a personal preference. In order to work both the files `rwobj.ins` and `rwobj.dtx` should be present in your working directory.
